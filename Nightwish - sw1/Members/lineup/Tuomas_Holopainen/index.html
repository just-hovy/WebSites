                <h1>Tuomas Holopainen</h1>
                <p>Tuomas Lauri Johannes Holopainen (born 25 December 1976) is a Finnish songwriter,
                    multi-instrumentalist and record producer, best known as the founder, leader, keyboardist and
                    songwriter of symphonic metal band Nightwish. He has also studied jazz and classical styles, but
                    prefers to be influenced by harmonic film music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before founding Nightwish, he has played in the band Darkwoods My Betrothed. He also collaborated
                    with the gothic metal band For My Pain... and the band of Timo Rautiainen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Holopainen has written several songs that have been included in movie soundtracks, including a
                    collaboration with Nightwish bass player, and male vocalist Marco Hietala on "While Your Lips Are
                    Still Red", for the Finnish film Lieksa! in 2007. He also co-wrote the music for Nightwish's own
                    film, Imaginaerum, released in November 2012.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Holopainen released his first solo album Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge in 2014.
                </p>
                <h3>Solo projects</h3>
                <p>Holopainen originally confirmed that he was producing a solo project in 2012. Holopainen stated
                    on his website, The Escapist, that he planned to devote his time completely to songwriting for the
                    project in Feb–April 2013 after the Nightwish Imaginaerum tour. In 2014 he released Music Inspired
                    by the Life and Times of Scrooge based on the comic book series "The Life and Times of Scrooge
                    McDuck" by Don Rosa. The record featured Nightwish musician Troy Donockley as well as the London
                    session musicians used previously in recent Nightwish releases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a November 2015 interview, he revealed plans to release a book with short fantasy and horror
                    stories influenced by Neil Gaiman and Stephen King.</p>
                <h3>Personal life</h3>
                <p>His parents were entrepreneur Pentti Holopainen and Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen, a former music and
                    English
                    teacher in a small elementary school. He has an older sister named Susanna who works as a
                    surgeon-urologist, and an older brother named Petri who is an autopsy assistant. He and singer Elina
                    Siirala are second cousins.[5] His musicality and skill in text expression showed early in school.
                    His mother signed him up for piano class in school when he was seven years old, and he later studied
                    clarinet, tenor saxophone, piano and music theory for twelve years at a music college. However, he
                    has not played the clarinet nor the saxophone since the mid-nineties. Originally aspiring to be a
                    biologist,[8] Holopainen had no interest in metal until his school foreign exchange partner took him
                    to
                    see Metallica and Guns N' Roses in America, and he became hooked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Holopainen is a fan of Disney, Tolkien and Dragonlance. In 2006 Holopainen said that he is "not
                    religious, but an open-minded, thinking individual". He does not consider "religion to be bad, but
                    human
                    interpretation of it."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Holopainen married Finnish pop singer Johanna Kurkela on 28 October 2015.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is a vegetarian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A new insect species, Sciophilia holopaineni, discovered by a Finnish biologist named Jukka Salmela
                    of
                    Metsähallitus Parks & Wildlife, has been named after Tuomas Holopainen, because of Holopainen's love
                    for
                    nature.
                </p>
