                <h1>Emppu Vuorinen</h1>
                <p>Erno Matti Juhani "Emppu" Vuorinen (born 24 June 1978) is a Finnish guitarist, most famous for being
                    a founding member and occasional songwriter of the symphonic metal band Nightwish. He is the oldest
                    of five children, having a twin brother and three younger sisters. He started to play guitar as a
                    private study at the age of 12 and since then has played in various bands including Nightwish,
                    Brother Firetribe, Barilari, Almah, and Altaria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Emppu is primarily a rhythm player, often supporting the keyboard or orchestral parts of Nightwish
                    songs. However, he plays lead melodies and solos as well. Vuorinen's solo techniques usually include
                    alternate picking, tapping, sliding, legato, and minor to extreme whammy bar use; he also employs
                    sweep picking, although very rarely. His solos are more melodic than those of most metal bands, but
                    he sometimes shreds (notably in "Nightquest," "The Pharaoh Sails to Orion," "Romanticide," and
                    "Gethsemane" by Nightwish, and also in "Traitor" by Tarot, for which he provided a solo).
                    Nightwish's first three albums feature a larger amount of lead guitar work from Emppu than their
                    later albums. Vuorinen has tuned his studio guitars in D tuning since the release of Century Child –
                    until then, his guitars were tuned in standard. During concerts, he has two guitars – one for each
                    tuning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vuorinen is also a creative force in Nightwish, having co-written songs with Tuomas Holopainen from
                    Oceanborn until Dark Passion Play. The song Whoever Brings The Night on Dark Passion Play is written
                    by Vuorinen alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Emppu recorded guitar parts for Almah, a Brazilian metal band, order to help his friend and vocalist
                    Edu Falaschi (former singer of Angra). Emppu did not stay in the band because of his obligations to
                    Nightwish. He is also involved with Brother Firetribe, an AOR band, which as of 2018 has released
                    four albums worldwide: "False Metal" (re-released as "Break Out"), "Heart Full Of Fire", "Diamond In
                    The Firepit" and "Sunbound".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vuorinen is often referred to as "the short one" or "the hobbit" when among band members or
                    fans, as he stands at just 5'3" (162 cm) in height.
                </p>
                <h3>Guitars</h3>
                <p>Vuorinen used a Washburn N4 Nuno Bettencourt signature guitar for live performances with Nightwish
                    from 1997–1999. Subsequently, he was most commonly seen with Washburn CS-780 guitars (a white one
                    and metallic purple one). He mostly used the white CS-780 until the recording of Century Child when
                    the band started tuning a whole tone lower than standard (DGCFAD instead of EADGBE). The documentary
                    on the End of Innocence DVD shows Vuorinen using his purple CS-780 to track parts of the song
                    "Slaying the Dreamer" (although he is also seen trying a white Tokai Les Paul copy on the same part
                    of the song). After Century Child was released in 2002 he used both CS-780s live, with the white one
                    in standard tuning and the purple one in D standard[citation needed]. The white CS had Duncan
                    Designed pickups, and the purple CS had a zebra Seymour Duncan humbucker in the neck position
                    (unknown model, but likely to be a Jazz since he now uses it on his signature guitars) and what
                    appears to be (judging by the black hexagonal polepieces[original research?]) a DiMarzio humbucker
                    in the bridge position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2004 Vuorinen started using an ESP custom shop version of the Horizon known as the EV-1. The EV-1
                    has an alder body, maple neck (neck through construction), ebony fingerboard, Seymour Duncan pickups
                    (a Duncan Custom TB-5 in the bridge, a SHR-1n Hot Rails in the middle, and a SH2-n Jazz in the
                    neck), 5 way switch, single volume control and a gold Floyd Rose tremolo system. He regularly used
                    two during live shows, a purple one tuned to DGCFAD and a white one tuned to EADGBE. After the
                    release of Dark Passion Play in 2007 he toured with a new signature guitar, the EV-2. This was very
                    similar to the purple EV-1, but now had a tone control and a large decal on the body known as the
                    "Harem Girl". The third incarnation of the series, the EV-3 appeared in 2012 featuring the
                    Imaginaerum cover art and no middle pickup. On the band's 2012/13 Imaginaerum World Tour, Vuorinen
                    used the EV-1 and EV-3. During rehearsals for Nightwish's eighth album Emppu has been using a new
                    custom guitar, built for him by Ruokangas Guitars.

                    Vuorinen used an ESP Eclipse in Vintage Black for the Dark Passion Play music videos. After seeing
                    that his distinctive purple guitar had suddenly gone, fans voiced their concerns; Vuorinen answered
                    this question via Nightmail:
