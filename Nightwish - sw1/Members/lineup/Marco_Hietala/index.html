                <h1>Marco Hietala</h1>
                <p>Marko Tapani "Marco" Hietala (born 14 January 1966) is a Finnish heavy metal vocalist, bassist and
                    songwriter. Internationally, he is most known as the current bassist, male vocalist and secondary
                    composer to Tuomas Holopainen, of the symphonic metal band Nightwish. He is also the vocalist and
                    bassist as well as composer and lyricist for the heavy metal band Tarot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is also a member of the supergroup Northern Kings, and portrayed one of the main characters in
                    Ayreon's 2013 album The Theory of Everything.</p>
                <h3>Equipment</h3>
                <p>Hietala uses Warwick bass guitars, particularly the Infinity NT (birdseye maple top) and Vampyre NT
                    (flame maple top) 4-string models tuned D Standard (DGCF) and Drop C (CGCF). He also owns a Warwick
                    Buzzard JE with a rusty finish equipped with a detuner (Used, among others, in the music videoes for
                    Elan and Endless Forms Most Beautiful), and a Kramer bass. He uses Warwick's Hellborg amplifier and
                    cabs. After joining Nightwish he used a SansAmp GT2 distortion pedal for some time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marco also uses a custom made Warwick/Framus doubleneck bass/electric guitar, based on the Warwick
                    Infinity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From Century Child until the End of an Era Marco used an Infinity almost exclusively for live and
                    studio applications. Later, the Vampyre became his axe of choice (almost for the whole period with
                    Anette as Nightwish's vocalist). The first time he can be seen with a Vampyre is the Bye Bye
                    Beautiful music video. From the Imaginaerum tour going forward Buzzard became his preferred brand,
                    but occasionally he still can be seen with an Infinity.
                </p>
                <h3>Personal life</h3>
                <p>Hietala has two children with his ex-wife Manki, twin boys Antto and Miro. He and his family
                    currently
                    live in Kuopio, Finland. When he is not touring, he enjoys reading books, playing video games, and
                    watching movies. He especially likes fantasy, horror and science fiction books, as mentioned in the
                    official Nightwish website. In 2016, Finnish newspaper reported that Hietala had filed for divorce.
                    He later remarried in August 2018 with Cami Balboa.
