                <h1>Troy Donockley</h1>
                <p>Troy Donockley (born 30 May 1964) is an English composer and multi-instrumentalist most known for his
                    playing of Uilleann pipes. Having performed with many artists as a session player, he is most
                    notable as a member of Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, which he has performed with since
                    2007 and joined as a full-time member in 2013.
                </p>
                <h3>Early life and career</h3>
                <p>
                    Donockley was born in Workington, Cumbria; his parents were members of a band called Travelling
                    Country. At the age of 16, Troy joined them, playing at many venues in West Cumbria. His father's
                    record collection was broad and gave his son a love of classical, rock, country as well as
                    traditional music. He is a multi-instrumentalist and a master of the Uilleann pipes. His ambition as
                    a teenager was to travel the world as a musician, but hated "empty pop created by cynical
                    twerps". The strangeness of the sound of the Uilleann pipes enabled him to become a session
                    musician with prog-rockers The Enid in 1987 on their album 'The Seed and the Sower'.
                </p>
                <h3>Nightwish</h3>
                <p>
                    Donockley's first appearance with Nightwish was on their 2007 release, Dark Passion Play, as a guest
                    musician, providing some whistles and pipes to the songs "The Islander", "Last of the Wilds", and
                    "Meadows of Heaven". He also joined them on select shows of the subsequent tour and appeared in the
                    music video for "The Islander". In 2011, Donockley appeared as a guest on Imaginaerum, providing
                    whistles, pipes, and vocals. He joined Nightwish again on the Imaginaerum World Tour, and also
                    appeared on the band's concert DVD 'Showtime, Storytime'. He also appears in the Imaginaerum film
                    from 2012 as a stage illusionist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the conclusion of the Imaginaerum World Tour, Donockley was made a full-time member of
                    Nightwish in October 2013.
                </p>
                <h3>Personal Life</h3>

                    vegan.
