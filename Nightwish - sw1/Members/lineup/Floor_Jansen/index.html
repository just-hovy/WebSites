                <h1>Floor Jansen</h1>
                <p>Floor Jansen (pronounced [ˈfloːr ˈjɑnsə(n)]; born 21 February 1981) is a Dutch singer, songwriter,
                    and vocal coach. She is currently the lead vocalist of Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish.
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Jansen first became known as a member of symphonic metal band After Forever, standing as their
                        lead
                        vocalist from 1997, when she joined at age 16, to their disbanding in 2009. When After Forever
                        disbanded, she formed ReVamp and has released two albums with them. In 2012 following the
                        departure
                        of their lead vocalist Anette Olzon, Nightwish brought in Jansen as a touring member until the
                        end
                        of their Imaginaerum World Tour. In 2013, they announced Jansen was now their full-time lead
                        vocalist; she subsequently disbanded ReVamp to focus on Nightwish. In 2018, she and Pagan's Mind
                        guitarist Jørn Viggo Lofstad premiered their hard rock duo Northward.

                        A frequent collaborator of Arjen Anthony Lucassen, she is a member of his progressive metal
                        supergroup Star One, and sang in the Ayreon albums Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream
                        Sequencer,
                        01011001, and The Source, as well as the live album Ayreon Universe – The Best of Ayreon
                        Live. She
                        also sang lead vocals in several songs of the MaYan album Quarterpast and in Avalon's Angels
                        of the
                        Apocalypse. She is the older sister of fellow singer Irene Jansen, who also worked with Ayre
                    </p>
                    <h3>Singing style</h3>
                    <p>Jansen can sing from classical to belting and raspy vocals like screaming and death growls.
                        She is a
                        soprano.

                        Jansen started studying music at the Dutch Rock Academy in 1999, entering the Conservatorium
                        Tilburg
                        three years later. She studied musical theatre and a year of opera.[21][22] Later, she
                        started
                        teaching performing in her own course called Wanna be a Star?!

                        She used to play the guitar, piano and flute and has completed several years of music
                        studies.</p>
                    <h3>Personal life</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a child, she wanted to be a biologist; coincidentally, she played the character "The
                        Biologist"
                        in
                        the Ayreon album The Source.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On 18 September 2016, it was announced, that Jansen and her husband Hannes Van Dahl, drummer
                        of
                        Sabaton,
                        were expecting their first child. On 15 March 2017, Jansen announced via Instagram that she
                        gave
                        birth to a baby girl, Freja.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jansen is vegetarian.

                        In 2018, a new species of beetle was discovered by scientist Andreas Weigel. It was named
                        after
                        Jansen,
                        dubbing it "Tmesisternus floorjansenae". This makes Floor Jansen the second Nightwish member
                        to
                        have a newly discovered species named after them, as a new kind of fungus gnat was
                        discovered back
                        in
                        2017 by Finnish biologist Jukka Salmela, who named the species after Tuomas Holopainen.
                        Jansen
                        herself
                        announced the news on Facebook.
