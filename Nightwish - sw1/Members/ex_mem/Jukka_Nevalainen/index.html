                <p>
                    Jukka Antero "Julius" Nevalainen (born 21 April 1978, Kitee, Finland) is the former drummer in both
                    the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish and the Finnish progressive metal band Sethian.
                </p>
                <h3>Personal life</h3>
                <p>
                    He spent his early years in the city of Kitee. His music teacher at school told him that a new
                    educational program for music was opening, and he thought Nevalainen would fit in well as a drummer.
                    He lacked a suitable place to practice so he made do at his home. His first band was "The Highway"
                    but he joined his first real band at the age of 15â€“16. The band had a rehearsal place, but was
                    restricted to practice only a couple of days a week. After he left that band, he joined up with
                    Emppu Vuorinen and they got a permanent practice place.[citation needed]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nevalainen lives with his wife Satu, daughter Luna (born in 2003) and son Niki (born on 19 December
                    2005) in Joensuu, Finland. His second daughter, Lara, was born on 22 June 2010. He is a
                    vegetarian.[2]
