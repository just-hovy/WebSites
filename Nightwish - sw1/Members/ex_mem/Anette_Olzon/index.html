                <h1>Anette Olzon</h1>
                <p>
                    Anette Ingegerd Olsson (born 21 June 1971), known by the stage name Anette Olzon, is a Swedish
                    singer, best known as the former lead vocalist of Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish from 2007
                    to 2012. She is also the vocalist of Swedish classic rock band Alyson Avenue, and of the Finnish
                    heavy metal band The Dark Element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Olzon was raised in a musical family and has been singing since childhood. Her mother also forced
                    her to play the oboe for 8 years. She toured with her mother's band and sang with them on some
                    occasions. Later, she started to take part in various talent shows and received laudable
                    recognition. The first band she joined at seventeen years of age (Take Cover) was a cover band.
                    However, it was short-lived as she took part in several bands and projects. At twenty-one, she
                    played the leading role in the rock opera/musical "Gränsland" in Helsingborg. After that she got
                    into the Balettakademien in Gothenburg. She sang in choirs, did studio work for various projects and
                    occasionally performed as a wedding singer. Olzon also sang a duet with Michael Bormann (ex-Jaded
                    Heart singer) on his album Conspiracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In her earlier days, Olzon took singing lessons at the Copenhagen Music Conservatorie, in Helsingør,
                    Denmark, with a private teacher. Nowadays, she takes lessons from a private teacher at the Malmö
                    Music University when needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before singing, Olzon has worked in a factory, in a hamburger restaurant, as a waitress, as a
                    veterinarian assistant, in a number of offices and as a hair dresser. She has also studied
                    musical artist education, psychology, project management and leadership and organization.
                </p>
                <h3>Personal life</h3>
                <p>Olzon lives in Helsingborg with her husband, former Pain bassist Johan Husgafvel, whom she
                    married on 10 August 2013,and her three children: sons, Seth (Blyckert) (born 11 July 2001)
                    from her first marriage, Nemo (born 30 July 2010), and Mio (born 28 March 2013). She is
                    currently studying nursing..</p>
