                <h1>Tarja Turunen</h1>
                <p>
                    Tarja Soile Susanna Turunen-Cabuli (born 17 August 1977), known professionally as Tarja Turunen or
                    simply Tarja, is a Finnish heavy metal singer-songwriter. She is a lyric soprano and has a vocal
                    range
                    of three octaves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turunen studied singing at Sibelius Academy and Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe. She is a
                    professional
                    classical lied singer, and the former lead vocalist of the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish,
                    which
                    she founded with Tuomas Holopainen and Emppu Vuorinen in 1996. Their combination of hard and fast
                    guitar
                    riffs with Turunen's dramatic, "operatic" lead vocals quickly achieved critical and commercial
                    popularity. Their symphonic metal style, soon dubbed "opera metal", inspired many other metal bands
                    and
                    performers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turunen was dismissed from the band on 21 October 2005 (just after the performance of the band's End
                    of
                    an Era concert) for personal reasons. She started her solo career in 2006 with the release of a
                    Christmas album called Henkäys ikuisuudesta. In 2007, Turunen released My Winter Storm, an album
                    featuring various styles including symphonic metal, and started the Storm World Tour. Turunen
                    released
                    her third album, What Lies Beneath, in 2010. She performed several concerts in Europe, playing in
                    metal
                    festivals including the Graspop Metal Meeting and the Wacken Open Air, before starting the What Lies
                    Beneath World Tour, which lasted until April 2012. Her first live DVD Act I was filmed during this
                    tour
                    on 30 and 31 March 2012 in Rosario, Argentina. Act I was released in August 2012. Turunen started
                    the
                    Colours in the Dark World Tour in October 2013 to promote her new album Colours in the Dark. Her
                    second
                    live DVD was filmed during the events of Beauty and the Beat and was released in May.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In September 2015, Tarja Turunen released her first classical studio album, Ave Maria – En Plein
                    Air. In
                    August 2016 she released The Shadow Self with a prequel EP The Brightest Void released on June 3.
                    Her
                    latest album In the Raw, was released in August 30, 2019.
                </p>
                <h3>Personal life</h3>
                <p>Turunen married Argentine businessman Marcelo Cabuli on December 31, 2002 – their wedding was
                    celebrated on July 2003; they lived in Buenos Aires with their daughter Naomi Eerika Alexia Cabuli
                    Turunen (born 2012). In an interview Tarja explained that in 2016 they had plans to move back to
                    Europe due to her touring schedule and that their daughter was starting school in the coming year.
                    She currently lives in the south of Spain (Andalusia).</p>
