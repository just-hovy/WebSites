                <h1>Nightwish</h1>
                <p>
                    Nightwish is a symphonic metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead
                    songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and former lead singer Tarja
                    Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami V채nsk채 after the
                    release of their debut album, Angels Fall First (1997). In 2001, V채nsk채 was replaced by Marco
                    Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest
                    singers.

                    Although Nightwish have been prominent in their home country since Angels Fall First, they did not
                    achieve wider success until the release of the albums Oceanborn (1998), Wishmaster (2000) and
                    Century Child (2002). Their 2004 album, Once, has sold more than one million copies and was the
                    band's breakthrough in the United States. Their biggest US hit single, "Wish I Had an Angel" (2004),
                    received MTV airplay and was included on three US film soundtracks to promote their North American
                    tour. The band produced three more singles and two music videos for Once, as well as a
                    re-recording of "Sleeping Sun" for the compilation album, Highest Hopes: The Best of Nightwish
                    (2005), before Turunen's dismissal in October 2005. Her last performance with Nightwish was
                    during a concert recorded for the live album/DVD End of an Era. After the concert, the other members
                    informed Turunen with an open letter that she was no longer a member of Nightwish.

                    In May 2007, Nightwish announced Anette Olzon as Turunen's replacement. That September, the band
                    released their sixth album, Dark Passion Play, which has sold almost 2 million copies. The album's
                    lead single, "Amaranth", became one of Nightwish's most successful in Europe. The supporting
                    tour, one of the band's largest, started on October 6, 2007 and ended on September 19, 2009.
                    The band released an EP/live album, Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places), in March 2009
                    as a CD/DVD, and their seventh studio album, Imaginaerum, was released globally on various days in
                    late 2011/early 2012.

                <p>
                    On October 1, 2012, Nightwish announced that they had parted ways with Olzon and would be finishing
                    the tour with at that time ReVamp vocalist (ex-After Forever) Floor Jansen. In October 2013,
                    Nightwish made Jansen and longtime session uilleann pipes player Troy Donockley permanent members of
                    the band, and they were featured in the acclaimed album Endless Forms Most Beautiful, released on
                    March 27, 2015.

                    Nightwish is the third-best-selling band and musical entity in Finland with certified sales of
                    nearly 900,000 certified copies. The group is also the most successful Finnish
                    band worldwide, selling more than 9 million records and receiving more than 60 gold and platinum
                    awards, having released five Number 1 albums and thirteen Number 1 singles. On October 26, 2018,
                    Nightwish was inducted into the Finnish Music Hall of Fame, becoming the honorary gallery's 11th
                    member.
