                        <h3>Nightwish Complete Work for New Album, Aim for Spring 2020 Release</h3>
                        <p>
                            It's been a while, but Nightwish are on their way back with new music. In a new interview,
                            vocalist Floor Jansen reveals that the group has completed their next release and they have
                            a target date for its release.

                            Jansen spoked with FaceCulture about the progress of the upcoming release (as seen in the
                            video interview below). "I think we've made a very cool new album. I'm very, very happy with
                            it," says Jansen. "I can't really say too much about it, because there are a couple of
                            things that are the same, a coupe of things that are different. But all I can say is I'm
                            very happy with it and I'm very excited about it. And I think people that already knew
                            Nightwish will really enjoy this.
